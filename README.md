# Super-Resolution-on-Images-using-Filter-Flow

The goal of this paper is to perform super resolution
on images. We try to generate images of higher resolution
from images of low resolution. We have proposed a lightweight
framework for this task. We use the concept of filter flow and a
two-stream lightweight neural network architecture to generate
high resolution images. As opposed to models that directly
predict output pixel values, this framework is controllable and
interpretable. We work using the concepts of filter flow.
